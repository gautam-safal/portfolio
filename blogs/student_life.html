  <h2>📝 Student Life in Computer Engineering in Nepal</h2>
  <p class="placeholder">11 june 2025 </p>

  <p>An unknown journey.<br>An imagined destination.</p>

  <p>Until grade 10, For me  <strong>Computer Engineering</strong> was supposed to mean building cool websites, launching mobile apps, and maybe even messing with AI/ML. That was the dream.</p>

  <p>Then came +2 with Computer Science. Surprised? Way easier than expected. Maybe it was my expectation. Maybe I thought it would be all zeros and ones from day one. But it felt chill.</p>

  <p>Then came <strong>C programming</strong>. And… it <em>was</em> fun.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, the chill disappeared. Enter: the <strong>IOE entrance exam</strong> — an unpresant  feeling of all. Stress levels sky-high. Everyone in panic mode. Hype, pressure, uncertainty that was all i got at the moment.</p>

  <p>And then… boom — I got admitted to <strong>ERC, Dharan</strong>. Relief, excitement, a dash of fear. “Engineering life, here I come!”</p>

  <p>Expectations? Low. Reality? Lower. The syllabus hit me like a Windows blue screen. Seniors told us it was the “new updated curriculum.” I was in the second batch. My reaction? <strong>“WTH did I sign up for?”</strong></p>

  <p>All theory. Labs with fancy equipments (but broken). Lectures that felt like time travel to the 90s. Group projects where the group didnot even existed. And the best part?<br> <em>“You’re in Computer Engineering, but please don’t submit assignments from your computer. Also, write code by hand in a notebook.”</em></p>

  <p>I mean… who needs a compiler when you’ve got a pen and paper, right?</p>

  <p>We barely got time to code at home. And no one was going to teach us anyway at college. But somehow, amidst all that noise… I felt like <strong>I made progress</strong>.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Learned the basics of Python from <strong>CS50</strong> (David Malan — you absolute legend 🙏)</li>
    <li>Installed <strong>Ubuntu</strong>, and instantly fell in love with the command line</li>
    <li>That joy of solving a bug after 10 failed attempts? Addictive.</li>
    <li>Finishing a project, tweaking it, <em>improving</em> it — deeply satisfying</li>
    <li>Chatting with seniors who dropped gold-level wisdom in 5 minutes? Game-changing</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <p>One of the most powerful chapters was the <strong>ACES TechFest 7.0</strong>, organized by our very own Association of Computer Engineering Students. I joined as an organizing member — especially for the main event: <strong>Hackathon</strong>.</p>

  <p>And… it wasn’t just about code. It was about teamwork, pressure, fun, failure, and discovery. Pulling an all-nighter, camping out with musics and snacks — pure magic. Learning from seniors, bonding with them, watching ideas turn into prototypes — priceless.</p>

  <p>That event taught me more than any course ever did. About tech. About life. About <strong>myself</strong>.</p>

  <p>Then there’s the other all-nighter — the <strong>semester exams</strong>. 😩 Imagine this: one brain, one syllabus, infinite stress. We pull an entire month's worth of effort in one chaotic burst. But somehow — like true engineers — we survive. And sometimes, even thrive.</p>

  <p>How can I forget the squad? Cleverly dumb, beautifully chaotic — the kind who’ll push you off the edge just to pull you back up laughing. We mess things up, we mess each other up — but we never let go. Same madness. Same mayhem. Same <strong>brotherhood</strong>.</p>

  <p>And that's how I finished my first semester. Entering into next semester with similar spirit and desire to do something <em>"Kehi Garxu"</em>.</p>
  <p>Some moments are just impossible to describe in words. But they’ll stay with me forever.</p>

  <p><strong>Student life in Computer Engineering in Nepal</strong> isn’t what most people expect. It’s not full of robots and AI and apps. It’s full of:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Crashed PCs</li>
    <li>Handwritten code</li>
    <li>Broken lab kits</li>
    <li>Self-taught lessons</li>
    <li>Friends who feel like family</li>
    <li>Late-night debugging and deeper conversations</li>
    <li>All nighters around exam weeks</li>
  </ul>

  <p>But also — Progress. Growth. Grit.</p>

  <blockquote>“You study Computer Engineering and you <strong>survive</strong> it. And in that survival, you discover yourself.”</blockquote>
  <br>
  <p><em>Still learning. Still struggling. Still showing up.</em></p>
